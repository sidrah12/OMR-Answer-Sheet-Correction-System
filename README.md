# OMR Answer Sheet Correction System
A fully automated system to evaluate OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) answer sheets. The system detects marked answers from scanned OMR sheets, compares them with a predefined answer key, calculates scores, and highlights the selected options on the sheet. Users can upload multiple sheets at once and download results in an Excel file.
